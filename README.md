# ✋🤖 Hand Gesture Recognition Model  
### SkillCraft Technology – Task 04

I’m excited to share **Task 04** of my Machine Learning internship at **SkillCraft Technology**!

In this task, I developed a **Hand Gesture Recognition Model** capable of identifying and classifying different hand gestures from **image or video data**.  
This task enhances intuitive **human–computer interaction (HCI)** and supports gesture-based control systems.

## 🗂️ Dataset

- **Dataset Used:** Hand Gesture Dataset  
- Contains multiple labeled hand gestures such as:
  - Thumbs Up  
  - Thumbs Down  
  - Fist  
  - Palm  
  - OK Sign  
  - Peace Gesture  
  - And more depending on the dataset

## 🚀 What I Did

### ✔️ Data Preprocessing
- Loaded gesture images  
- Applied resizing, normalization  
- Augmented data to improve accuracy  
- Converted images into NumPy arrays  

### ✔️ Model Development
- Built a **CNN-based** hand gesture recognition model  
- Used convolutional layers, max-pooling, dropout, and dense layers  
- Compiled the model using:
  - Loss: *categorical_crossentropy*
  - Optimizer: *Adam*
  - Metrics: *Accuracy*

### ✔️ Model Training
- Trained on gesture images  
- Used validation split to check overfitting  
- Plotted training vs. validation accuracy and loss  

### ✔️ Evaluation
- Achieved high gesture recognition accuracy  
- Generated a classification report  
- Tested predictions on sample images
